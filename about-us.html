        <!-- Background of St. Francis College Athletic Program -->
        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1859, St. Francis College has a rich history of athletic excellence. The Terriers have competed at the highest levels, bringing glory to our college and forging lifelong bonds among student-athletes.</p>
            <p>However, in recent years, our beloved athletic program faced challenging times and was unfortunately shut down. This decision left many former student-athletes feeling disconnected and longing for the sense of community they once had.</p>

            <h2>Personal Story</h2>
            <p>As a former water polo player at St. Francis College, I understand firsthand the profound impact that being part of a collegiate athletic program can have on one's life. The camaraderie, discipline, and sense of purpose that I experienced as a student-athlete shaped me in ways I never imagined.</p>
            <p>Driven by my passion for keeping our community together, I embarked on a mission to create a platform where former student-athletes like myself can reconnect, support each other, and continue to thrive beyond the playing field.</p>
